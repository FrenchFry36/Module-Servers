# Challenge: A Chat Server

## Overview: what is this challenge?

In this challenge you must make an Express app which provides an API to manage a list of chat messages, in JSON format.

A simple front-end has been provided to allow you to test _some_ of the functionality.

In the optional 'React' part of this challenge, you also make a React app which allows you to read, add and delete messages, backed by your new server.

## Pre-reqs

- [ ] You should have completed at least Level 1 of the Quote Server challenge before attempting this challenge.

## Level 1 Challenge - make the chat server

At this first level, your API must allow a client to:

- [V] Create a new message
- [V] Read all messages
- [V] Read one message specified by an ID
- [ ] Delete a message, by ID

* [V] All message content should be passed as JSON.

* [V] Your routes should match the patterns established in class (RESTful). See the later spoiler section "Correct Routes" if you need the answer.

You can use [this chat tester client](https://cyf-chat-tester.netlify.com/) to test your routes.

### Data model

Each chat message is an object with the following properties:

| Name   | Type   | Example  |
| ------ | ------ | -------- |
| `id`   | number | 17       |
| `from` | string | "Neill"  |
| `text` | string | "hi CYF! |

## Go ahead!

If you think you know how to do that, go ahead!

Try to use what you know to do this challenge on your own. It does not require any new knowledge.

## End of Level 1 challenge!

Well done! Open your pullrequest and get it reviewed.

## üèùÔ∏è Stretch challenges

The remaining challenges below are stretch challenges - you can have go at these once you've completed the Level 1 challenge.

## Level 2 - simple validation

For this level, your server must:

- [ ] _reject_ requests to create messages if the message objects have an empty or missing `text` or `from` property.
  - [ ] In this case your server should return a status code of `400`.

(Advanced note: people don't actually agree on the best status code for this situation.)

### A note on security

There is intentionally no security or ownership of messages - anyone can delete one or all messages on your server.

This is a big topic for further study. We won't try to cover it in this challenge.

## Level 3 - more "read" functionality

For this level your API _must_ also allow a client to:

- [ ] Read _only_ messages whose text contains a given substring: `/messages/search?text=express`
- [ ] Read only the most recent 10 messages: `/messages/latest`

## Level 4 - Optional - add a timestamp, `timeSent`

For this level, the server must:

- [ ] store a timestamp in each message object, in a field called `timeSent`.
- [ ] This should be set to the current time when the server first receives the message. This should be a DateTime object, which can be created with `new Date()`. It will NOT be submitted by the client.

## Level 5 - Optional - add message _update_ functionality

If you want, you can also:

- [ ] add support for the client to be able to _update_ a message's `text` or `from` property. We'll cover this in the next week of the module, but you can research it easily.

- [ ] Your server should NOT update the `timeSent` timestamp property during an update, if the client passes it back to you.

## Challenge: Advanced: Add a React app as a front-end

Note: only do this if you have done all other Node homework this week - including Levels 1-3 of this challenge. The priority during the node module is _node_!

- [ ] Make a very simple React app called chat-react-app

You can either use a CYF provided template or use Vite to create a new React app.

```shell
npm create vite@latest chat-react-app --template react
```

#### Your UI should at least:

- [ ] Display the latest messages on load
- [ ] Provide a "see latest" button to fetch and display the latest messages
- [ ] Provide a "delete" button or a clickable icon next to each message.
  - [ ] When clicked this should delete the message from the server and then from the local display.

#### Optionally, your UI may also:

- [ ] Load and re-display the latest messages every 30 seconds.
- [ ] Allow the user to use as much as possible of the back-end that you developed in levels 1-4 (e.g. message search).

#### Don't forget:

- [ ] You'll have to enable CORS on the express app (see note below)
  - For how to post JSON, Read ["Using Fetch", on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)
- [ ] Host your react app on netlify

#### Enabling CORS on the Express app

You'll have to install and enable CORS on your server in order to allow your JSON to be loaded from a different server than your React app has been loaded from.

In your express project, edit your `package.json` to add a dependency for the latest version of cors (e.g. `"cors": "^2.8.5"`)

Then in your `server.js` add...

`const cors = require('cors')` or `import cors from 'cors'`

and

`app.use(cors())`

Read more or CORS [here](https://codeyourfuture.github.io/syllabus-master/others/cors.html)
and in CORS in Express [here](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cors.html).

### Spoiler: Correct Routes

| method | example path   | behaviour              |
| ------ | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| GET    | `/messages`    | return all messages    |
| GET    | `/messages/17` | get one message by id  |
| POST   | `/messages`    | create a new message   |
| DELETE | `/messages/17` | delete a message by id |
